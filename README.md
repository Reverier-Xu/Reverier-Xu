Developing something interesting.

1. Please **DO NOT** bring any of your political, gender/LGBT+ and other non-technical views to me and my projects. I just treat you as a human, don't want to know anything about you and your views.
2. I will try my best to solve issues in open source projects, but please **DO NOT** rush me or regard it as my obligation.
3. My projects are currently all non-profit, some of them are not opensource. If you use my software, plz **DO NOT** ask me to opensource it, unless I violate some license.

Non-opensource Projects:

1. [Ret2Shell (回归终端)](https://github.com/ret2shell), the most wellknown instance is [西电 CTF 终端](https://ctf.xidian.edu.cn)
