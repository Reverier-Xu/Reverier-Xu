1. Please don't bring any of your political, LGBT and other non-technical views to me and my project. I just treat you as a human, don't want to know anything about yourself and your views.
2. I will try my best to solve issues in open source projects, but please don't rush me or regard it as my obligation.
3. My projects are currently all non-profit, even if they are not open source. If you use my software, plz do not ask me to opensource it which I have not opensourced yet, unless I violate some license.
